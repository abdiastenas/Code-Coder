Code Coder Tasks.

Tuesday Tasks.
  1. Based on the video, there is two process for languages: Compiled and Interpreted. A compiled program is when the source code is fully read with a compiler, and convert it to a compiled executable program for the computer to execute it. An interpreted program, the source code is read one line at a time with an interpreter, executing each line right after reading it.


  2. Answer: Java is both a compiled and interpreted language. The language uses a Java compiler called "javac" that produces a .class file that contains bytecode. This file then is put into the software-based interpreter called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to interpret it and then the machine will execute the Java application with the desired output.


  3. Step one: Define the local currency = Quetzal Guatemalteco (QT). Step two: Define the final currency output= US Dollar (USD). Step three: Define the USD currency value= 0.13 USD. Step four: Define the value of the QT currency= Q1. Step five: Multiply the value of QT times the value of the USD= Q1 x 0.13 USD. Step Six: Display the final result with the US Dollar currency next to the final value= Q100 x 0.13 USD= 12.97 USD.


  4. Pseudocode is basically solving the coding problem with words and sentences understable to people, letting you plan specific steps in a way you would follow a food recipe to solve a coding problem, then taking that planned idea and translate it to code.


  5. Answer: Pseudocode is helpful to plan how to solve a problem by using logic and a language any person can understand. It can help to breakdown a problem into pieces, solve it little by little and then come up with a final solution. This is only to have a clear mental map of how to code the solution later on.


  6. - If the user base was born in the year 2022, then set the age to 0. - Else add 1 year of value for each decreased year value of 2022.


  7. A flowchart is a diagram that describes a process or system. It can help to visually demonstrate the workflow of a system, by showing a sequence of steps, what order and in what hierarchy do these steps exist in order to obtain a specific result.


  8. Answer: The flowcharts can be used as mental maps to implement the step by step solutions that help visualize what will each step will do, and what that next step will do next, and so on.


  9. What is the difference between a High-level language and a Low-level language:
A High-level language is easy to understand for a person, but it is more complex for the computer to read and execute. Therefore a Low-level language is meant for computers that can easily read it, while for a person it would make little sense to read it.

There are two types of High-level languages:

High-level language:

Interpreted: This language reads and translates the high level language code, line by line, and then executes the code per line. If there is an error, it wont notice it until it is finished reading all the lines.

Compiled: This type of language reads all the code first, validates them, creating a low level code, after that it it creates and executable object and then the computer executes it.
*Source Code - Compiled - Organized for execution - Execution by computer.*


Low-level language:

Assembler: This type of language is a group of mnemonics that represent basic instructions for the hardware components. This is a low level language.

Binary: Which is the lowest level of code that the computer and its components can actually understand and read with ease.
