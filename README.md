Code Coder Tasks.

Tuesday Tasks.
  1. Finished watching the video.
  2. Answer: Java is both a compiled and interpreted language. The language uses a Java compiler called "javac" that produces a .class file that contains bytecode. This file then is put into the software-based interpreter called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to interpret it and then the machine will execute the Java application with the desired output.
  3. Step one: Define the local currency = Quetzal Guatemalteco. Step two: Define the final currency output= US Dollar. Step three: Define the USD currency value= 0.13 USD. Step four: Define the value of the QT currency= Q1. Step five: Multiply the amount of QT times the value of the USD= Q1 x 0.13 USD. Step Six: Display the final result with the abbrevation for the US Dollar currency next to the final value= Q100 x 12.97 USD= 1.30 USD.
