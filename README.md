Code Coder Tasks.

Tuesday Tasks.
  1. Finished watching the video.
  2. Answer: Java is both a compiled and interpreted language. The language uses a Java compiler called "javac" that produces a .class file that contains bytecode. This file then is put into the software-based interpreter called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to interpret it and then the machine will execute the Java application with the desired output.
  3. Step one: Define the local currency = Quetzal Guatemalteco (QT). Step two: Define the final currency output= US Dollar (USD). Step three: Define the USD currency value= 0.13 USD. Step four: Define the value of the QT currency= Q1. Step five: Multiply the value of QT times the value of the USD= Q1 x 0.13 USD. Step Six: Display the final result with the US Dollar currency next to the final value= Q100 x 0.13 USD= 12.97 USD.
  4. Finished reading the article on Pseudocode.
  5. Answer: Pseudocode is helpful to plan how to solve a problem by using logic and a language any person can understand. It can help to breakdown a problem into pieces, solve it little by little and then come up with a final solution. This is only to have a clear mental map of how to code the solution later on.
