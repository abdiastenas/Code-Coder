# Week 2 Challenges ðŸ’»ðŸ˜Ž

## TUESDAY TASKS

#### 1.  [Multiply](https://www.codewars.com/kata/50654ddff44f800200000004)

### Solution:
	function multiply(a, b){
  		//This variable writes a variable called 'multi'
  		//that uses a multiply operator to give a final result for a and b.
  		let multi = a * b;
  	//This returns the final result of the multiply operation inside the 'multi' variable.
  			return multi;
			}

#### 2. [ASCII Total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/572b6b2772a38bc1e700007a)

### Solution:
	function uniTotal (string) {
	   //This variable count has the value of 0. Will be used for returning an int.
	   let count = 0;
	  //This FOR loop starts reiterating at each index position of the string.
	  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
		//Count is added to the result of the string method found at its index.
		count += string.charCodeAt(i);
	  }
	  //This returns the final value of count after the sum.
	  return count;
	}

#### 3. [get character from ASCII Value](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55ad04714f0b468e8200001c)

### Solution:
	function getChar(c){
	  //The string method takes each int and returns its equivalent of a character.
	  return String.fromCharCode(c);
	}

#### 4. [Binary Addition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551f37452ff852b7bd000139)
### Solution:
	function addBinary(a,b) {
	  //The first variables returns as value the sum of two variables. The second variable has an empty string.
	  let sum = a + b; binary = '';
	  //function loop while takes the condition that if the final result of sum is bigger than 0,
	  while ( sum > 0 ) {
	  //then the binary string will take the remainder of sum variable, then perform and add operation with the binary value '',
	  // and then it will round up or down an integer after dividing the sum into 2.
		binary = ( sum % 2 ) + binary; sum = Math.floor ( sum / 2 )
	  };
	  //This will return the final value of binary as a string.
	  return binary;
	}

#### 5. [Student's Final Grade](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ad0d8356165e63c140014d4)
100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases.

### Solution:
	function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
	  // Using an if conditional, on this first iteration, it will check for
	  //the value of exam if its bigget than 90 or if the value of projects is bigger than 10, it will return a final grade of 100.
	  if (exam > 90 || projects > 10) {
		return 100;
	  }
	  //else if conditional will check if the value of exam is bigger than 75
	  //and if projects value is equal or bigger than 5, returning a final grade of 90.
	  else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5) {
		return 90;
	  }
	  //this conditional will check if exam is bigger than 50 and if projects is equal or bigger than 2,
	  //returning a final grade of 75.
	  else if ( exam > 50 && projects >= 2) {
		return 75;
	  }
	  //this else conditional will return 0 if the conditionals before this one are not met.
	  else {
		return 0;
	  }
	}

## WEDNESDAY TASKS

#### 1. [Holiday VIII - Duty Free](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57e92e91b63b6cbac20001e5)

### Solution:
	function dutyFree(normPrice, discount, hol){
	  //This is a dividend and multiply operation to find the amount of bottles needed to buy.
	  // the Math.floor just rounds up or down the final number of the division and multiply operations.
	  return Math.floor(hol/((normPrice*discount)/100));


#### 2. [Twice as old](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b853229cfde412a470000d0)
### Solution:
	function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
	  //This variable makes the operation of the number of dadYearsOld minus the multiply between the number
	  //of sonYearsOld times two. Meaning double the number of the fathers age.
	  let twiceAsOld = dadYearsOld - (sonYearsOld * 2);
	  //This rounds up the integer in case there is any floating points.
	  return Math.abs(twiceAsOld);
	}

#### 3. [Valid Spacing](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f77d62851f6bc0033616bd8)

### Solution:
	function validSpacing(s) {
	//Using a ternary operator, we asked the function to return if the string has valid spacing with booleans.
	// So if s is equal to an empty string, then it is true.
	//If the split method returns an array of the spaces inside the string,
	//then the find method, returns the first character inside the string.
	  return s=='' ? true : s.split(' ').find(el=> el=='') >= 0 ? false : true
	}

#### 4. [Fake Binary](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eae65a4321032ce000002d)
### Solution: Could not solve it by myself.
	function fakeBin(x){
	  return x.split('').map((num) => num > 4 ? 1 : 0).join('');
	}

## THURSDAY TASKS

#### 1. Remove all exclamation marks from the end of sentence.

Examples
remove("Hi!") === "Hi"
remove("Hi!!!") === "Hi"
remove("!Hi") === "!Hi"
remove("!Hi!") === "!Hi"
remove("Hi! Hi!") === "Hi! Hi"
remove("Hi") === "Hi"

### Solution:
	//This one took a while... no pun intended, but I first tried to use the for loop, and got stucked,
	//then found out about the slice string method, but got stuck with the index position, so I had to go find
	//the solution on google and found out that I was missing the -1 index position which starts counting backwards at the end of the string.
	function remove (string) {
	  // The while loop iteration searches if the value inside string
	  //and the .slice() method returned the same value inside the array meaning both had the string'!'
	  // count from -1 or backwards in the index positions of the string, then!
	  while (string && string.slice (-1) == '!'){
		//This variable is run using the .slice() method to count from the position zero
		//and last positiong of the string counting backwards.
		string = string.slice(0,-1);
	  }
	  //This returned the value of string after the code above.
	  return string;
	}
	*/

#### 2. Create a function called shortcut to remove the lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u ) in a given string.

### Solution:
	function shortcut (string) {
	  //The replace string method replaces every character inside the array with an empty string.
	  //The regex was new for me so that had to be copied and pasted in a blink of an 'i'.
	  return string.replace(/[aeiou]/ig,'');
	}

#### 3. Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

### Solution:
	//I was not able to solve this on my own due to time constrict issues.
	const rps = (p1, p2) => {
	  const pattern = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];
	  const p1Index = pattern.findIndex((v) => v === p1);
	  const p2Index = pattern.findIndex((v) => v === p2);

	  if ((p1Index + 1) % 3 === p2Index) {
		return 'Player 2 won!';
	  }
	  if ((p1Index + 2) % 3 === p2Index) {
		return 'Player 1 won!';
	  }

	  return 'Draw!';
	};

#### 4. Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

### Solution:
//Pending.
